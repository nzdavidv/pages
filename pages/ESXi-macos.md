# Overview
Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Technically yep it worked and I wound up with a VM running macOS Sonoma.

It's not super painfully slow but it's slow enough to be annoying. It doesn't spark joy.

But I guess if you needed an Apple VM for managing apple devices or some reason then yep it works.
